# Developer Setup

The easiest way to start an app is to run with a docker.

You can just use docker compose command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

And run one under the WSL or Linux to populate DB when started:
```bash
bash populate-db.sh
```

Docker execution was tested under the Windows and docker based on the WL2 Ubuntu.
